# Template GO

## App Structure
This template follows the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principle

### Interface
The `interface` layer is responsible for handling the communication between the external world and the application. This includes HTTP handlers, middleware, and any other components that interact with external systems.
- HTTP Handlers: These are responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. They parse incoming requests, call the appropriate services, and return the responses.
- Middleware: Middleware functions are used to process requests before they reach the handlers. Common uses include authentication, logging, and request validation.
  
### Infrastructure
The `infrastructure` layer contains the implementation details of external systems and services that the application depends on. This includes database connections, third-party services, and other external resources.

- Database Repositories: These are responsible for interacting with the database. They contain methods for querying and manipulating data.
- JWT Authentication: This handles the creation and validation of JWT tokens for authentication purposes.
  
### Domain
The `domain` layer contains the core business logic of the application. This is where the main entities, value objects, and business rules are defined.

- Entities: These are the core objects of the application, such as `User` and `Auth`.
- Repositories: Interfaces that define the methods for data access. The actual implementation is provided in the infrastructure layer.
- Services: These contain the business logic and use the repositories to interact with the data.

### Application
The `application` layer contains the application-specific logic that orchestrates the use of domain services and entities. This layer is responsible for implementing use cases and application workflows.

- Services: These are higher-level services that coordinate the use of domain services to fulfill application-specific requirements.
  
## Installation
1. Install dependencties
```sh
$ go mod tidt
```
2. Set up enviroment variables
   Create a `config.yaml` file in the project root and add the necessary environment variables
```yaml
app:
    name: 
    environment:

database:
    host:
    port:
    username:
    password:
    name:

server:
    port:

auth:
    jwt_secret:
    token_expiration: # in second

user:
    password_min_length:
```
3. Run the application
   ```sh
   $ go run cmd/api/main.go
   ```
